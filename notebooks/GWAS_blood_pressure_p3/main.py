    # Introduction

    This notebook demonstrates typical initial steps in a genetic association analysis: filtering, LD-pruning, and Principal Component analysis.

    This notebook hopes to help you understand the following steps in performing an association test in BioData Catalyst:

    1. We will import the phenotype.csv generated in the "2-GWAS-phenotypic-data-preparation" notebook.

    2. Next, we import, explore, and perform quality control on genotypic data.

    3. Once we're satisfied that everything looks reasonable, we process the genetic data to better adjust for relatedness within our set of samples. Relatedness can easily confound GWAS results and we must take care to account for it in our analysis.

    4. We write our results to prepare a set of input parameters and data for a genomewide association analysis pipeline.

    5. The final cells of the notebook demonstrate how to generate a new Terra data model that links all of the data generated in the notebook and allows for easy import into the workflows that perform the association tests.


    # Set up your notebook

    ## Select your Jupyter environment

    In the gear wheel at the top right of this notebook you can select the docker image or "Environment" to use. We suggest using the environment with the most update to date Hail package (for example: Python 3.7.6, Hail 0.2.30)

    ## Set your runtime configuration based on your cost and time needs

    * Your compute needs will be based on the size of your VCF and your cost concerns.
    * You can learn more about Terra's [runtime environment](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360027237871) and how to [control cloud costs](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360029772212).
    * Configure your notebook runtime using the gear wheel at the top right to use a spark cluster for parallel processing. You can learn more about Spark in the Hail section below.
    * A suggested custom configuration using a 100GB VCF file is below. For larger files, consider using more workers.
    * Using pre-emptibles is not recommended for analyses that take longer than 6 hours. For large-scale GWAS data preparation, this may be the case depending on the number of workers you request for parallel processing of your variant matrix.

    # Work with genotype data using Hail

    Now that we have a handle on the phenotype data, we can begin to work with the genotype data. We will make use of the [Hail](hail.is) software package, an "open-source, general-purpose, Python-based data analysis tool with additional data types and methods for working with genomic data." Hail utilizes distributed computing with Apache Spark for efficient genome-wide analysis.

    ## Goals of this section
    1. Load genotype data from variant call format (VCF) files into the compute environment
    2. Understand how to access genotype and variant information
    3. Generate variant quality control metrics
    4. Keep only those samples with phenotype data


    ### A short primer on Hail:
    Hail uses distributed computing -- a way of parallelizing tasks that can greatly decrease the **real** time it takes to complete an analysis. While distributed computing decreases **real** time, the time that you or I experience, it does not decrease **computational** time, the product of *# machines* and *time each machine was running*. Distributed computing relies on an operation called *partitioning*, dividing a object into many, many pieces. The number of partitions determines, in part, the number of operations that can run in parallel. In the code below, you will see syntax like `min_partitions = 200`. In English, this is saying "at the minimum, divide my data into 200 pieces". This parameter can vary and should be determined based on the data and the particular operations that you want to do -- more partitions is not always better.

    It is important to note that Hail expressions are **lazy** -- they are not evalutated until absolutely needed. For example, using Python for the expression `x = 2+2` would immediately store the value of `x` as `4`. However, calling the same expression using Hail would instead store `x` as `2+2` until the variable `x` was explicitly used. When using some of the code below, you will notice that some code blocks will run astoundingly quickly. This does not mean that the operation is complete, rather that the operation's result was not yet needed. When a results is needed, the operation will run. This should become more clear when working through this notebook.

    For more information, checkout the [Hail documentation](http://www.nealelab.is/tools-and-software) and this [helpful video](https://youtu.be/0RTgBYL5x_E).

    ## Import VCF from workspace

    In the notebook 1-copy-vcf-to-workspace, you copied your VCF of interest to your Terra workspace bucket and extracted the contents of the tar file. After extraction, you should see 23 VCFs (that represent a single VCF per chromsoome) in the "Files" section of the data tab of your workspace (or the variable 'bucket' below). Next, you will create an array to these files in the bucket and interact with them using Hail.

    ## Load VCF data and perform variant QC

    To load genotype data from VCF files, use the <font color='red'>import_vcf</font> function. This will convert the VCF files into a distributed data type, a **matrix table** (**mt**), storing small pieces of each file independently to allow for fast access and computation. A matrix table is composed of 3 parts: sample annotations (columns), variant annotations (rows), and entries (genotypes). Use the following syntax to load the 1000 Genomes data:

    ```python
    mt = hl.import_vcf(vcf_paths)
    ```

    The structure of the matrix table can be viewed by <font color='red'>describing</font> the object:

    ```python
    mt.describe()
    ```

    The number variants and samples (rows and columns) can be seen by calling <font color='red'>count</font>:

    ```python
    mt.count()
    ```

    You can merge phenotypes with the VCF data by matching sample IDs between objects. Recall that the *sample* column of the phenotype data held unique IDs for each sample. These same sample IDs are stored in the VCF files and index the matrix table columns. <font color='red'>annotate_cols</font> can be used to add the phenotypes to the matrix table columns. `samples[mt.s]` matches samples IDs between objects and <font color='red'>annotate_cols</font> merges into the VCF:

    ```python
    samples = hl.Table.from_pandas(samples, key = 'sample')
    mt = mt.annotate_cols(pheno = samples[mt.s])
    ```

    To generate variant level summary statistics, use <font color='red'>variant_qc</font>. This will compute useful metrics like allele frequencies, call rate, and homozygote counts, among many others. Run variant_qc and take a look at how the matrix table structure changes.

    ```python
    mt = hl.variant_qc(mt)

    # Understanding population structure within our sample
    ----

    Many of our statistical tests are built on the assumption of unrelated data points and require adjustment to account for population structure. There are various ways to quantify population structure, but most start by generating a set of markers (variants) that are nearly independent of one another. For this, we will use an operation called *Linkage Disequalibrium pruning* to extract a set of variants that we can use for calculating relatedness. See [this resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkage_disequilibrium) for more information on LD.

    Next, we will use principal component analysis (PCA) to transform the genetic data into a space that will aid in modeling by allowing us to more easily visualize genetic distance between individuals.

    ## Goals of this section
    1. Generate a list of variants for calculated relatedness by filtering and LD-pruning
    2. Calculate principal components using Hail
    3. Visualize individuals within PC space

    ## LD-pruning

    We'll want to only include variants that are (nearly) independent of each other. We'll accomplish this using linkage disequalibrium pruning with the <font color='red'>ld_prune</font> function. Inputs are the genotypes, an r^2 threshold, and a window size. These last two parameters control how strict we are in our definition of independence. The final parameter *block_size* relates to parallelization and should not be changed. More information can be found in the [Hail documentation](https://www.hail.is).

    ```python
    pruned_variants = hl.ld_prune(mt.GT, r2 = 0.2, bp_window_size = 100000, block_size = 1024)
    ```

    The last step is to filter the matrix table again by the pruned variants list. For this, <font color='red'>is_defined</font> is useful:

    ```python
    mt = mt.filter_rows(hl.is_defined(pruned_variants[mt.row_key]))
    ```

    ## Principal Component Analysis

    In this next section, we'll cover a method for easily visualizing and adjusting for population structure in an association analysis: Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

    You run PCA using the function <font color='red'>hwe_normalized_pca</font>. For this analysis, we are mainly interested in the scores, and can disregard the eigenvalues and loadings. The `k` parameter determines the number of PCs to return -- as `k` grows, so does the computation time.

    ```python
    _, pcs, _ = hl.hwe_normalized_pca(mt.GT, k=5)
    ```

    The PCs can then be added to the matrix table in much the same way as phenotypes. Use <font color='red'>annotate_cols</font>. (<font color='blue'>Hint:</font> the pcs object has multiple fields, use <font color='red'>describe</font> to find the field that you want to keep. Don't forget to match over the sample IDs.)

    Finally, let's visualize the results. Hail has some efficient built-in plotting functions -- let's use <font color='red'>plot.scatter</font>. Choose which PCs you'd like to plot and a categorical phenotype value to color the points.

    ```python
    p = hl.plot.scatter(mt.scores[0],
                        mt.scores[1],

    ## Generate a new Terra data model called "sample_set" and add all of our derived data files to this entity.

    The last step in the analysis is to update **your** workspace data table with the data generated in this notebook. For downstream analysis, you'll want to set up all the needed parameters and input data directly in the data table. As you will see, analysis workflows look to the data table for configuration and inputs.

    Recall that each *sample* in the data table corresponded to a single individual. To run a GWAS requires a set of samples, or in Terra terms, a **sample_set**. This entity should include everything you might need to run a workflow for genotype-phenotype modeling: a list of samples to include, phenotype data, a list of covariates, an outcome, a genetic relatedness matrix, and a label. The particular workflow that you will soon run looks for inputs in specific columns of the data table.

    Below is a helpful function for generating a sample set in the correct format so you will have success in the next part this template. To look at the full code, click the arrow at the top left of the cell.

    In a GWAS, you may iterate through an analysis multiple times by filtering your data differently or including/excluding covariates. For each separate run, you can cange the values in the columns, specifically the value in the sample_set_id column to reflect a new analysis. You will see that you can save each notebook you used for each iteration as well.
