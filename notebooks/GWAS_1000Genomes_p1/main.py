    ## Notebook Overview

    This notebook consolidates the phentotypic data in tables imported to Terra from Gen3 into one consolidated table of metadata with familiar subject IDs for downstream analysis. It uses functions defined in the [terra_data_table_util notebook](https://terra.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/#workspaces/biodata-catalyst/BioData%20Catalyst%20Collection/notebooks/launch/terra_data_table_util.ipynb?), and can be adapted to consolidate different metadata. If you are using this notebook as a template workspace, then terra_data_table_util is likely already in this workspace, but if it's not in your list of notebooks, you will want [to clone it](https://doc-0g-2g-docs.googleusercontent.com/docs/securesc/tr1c63atj2dnc8up8k72p0bk5mf4cjae/7i39ou6tv8etf7hbcvddlgguqfr6p2ad/1608658425000/02948814035259017789/02710643537415029250/1MP4G9QHGiYBK-9pZc3ogz9Jrv19y8a2E?authuser=0) from the Biodata Catalyst [notebook collection workspace](https://terra.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/#workspaces/biodata-catalyst/BioData%20Catalyst%20Collection/notebooks).

    ## Set up your notebook
    ----

    ### Set runtime values
    If you are opening this notebook for the first time, and you did not edit your runtime settings before starting it, you will now need to change your settings. Click on the gear icon in the upper right to edit your Notebook Runtime. Set the values as specified below:
    <table style="float:left">
        <thead>
            <tr><th>Option</th><th>Value</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
             <tr><td>Application Configuration</td><td>Default (GATK 4.1.4.1, Python 3.7.9, R 4.0.3)</td></tr>
              <tr><td>CPUs</td><td>4</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Memory (GB)</td><td>15</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Startup script</td><td>(leave blank)</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Compute Type</td><td>Standard VM</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Disk size (GB)</td><td>50</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

# HTML tables should be followed by a new cell because otherwise text gets jammed next to them

    Click the "Replace" button when you are done, and Terra will begin to create a new runtime with your settings. When it is finished, it will pop up asking you to apply the new settings.

    ### Check kernel type

    A kernel is a _computational engine_ that executes the code in the notebook. You can think of it as defining the programming language. For this notebook, we'll use a `Python 3` kernel. In the upper right corner of the notebook, just under the Notebook Runtime, it should say `Python 3`. If it doesn't, you can switch it by navigating to the Kernel menu and selecting `Change kernel`.

    The consolidate_gen3_pheno_tables function:
    * Joins all phenotypic data tables into a single consolidated_metadata table in the Terra data section
    * This join forces all entities (individuals) to be present in every clinical table, so some individuals may be removed. Consider how this affects your dataset.
    * Renames attribute fields to have a prefix of the original entity type (for example: "demographic_annotated_sex", where demographic is the original entity type, annotated_sex is the attribute field)

    When working on data imported from Gen3, you will see most columns have names beginning with "pfb:" before the rest of the column name such as pfb:demographic_annotated_sex. PFB, which stands for Portable Format for Bioinfomatics, is a common namespace attribute that aids in interoperability with other NIH ecosystems.
