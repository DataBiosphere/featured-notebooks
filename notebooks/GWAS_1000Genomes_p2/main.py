    # GWAS Initial Analysis
    *version: 2.0.6*

    # Introduction
    ----

    This notebook demonstrates typical initial steps in a genetic association analysis: exploring phenotype distributions, filtering and PD-pruning, and Principal Component analysis. It has been written to be interactive, allowing you to make choices as you go.
        You should treat this notebook as a real analysis, where you will need to carefully consider aspects of the dataset to accurately model genotype-phenotype relationships. In particular, you will want to identify covariation of traits and population structure. These two aspects are among the most common causes of confounding within a GWAS.

    By the end of this notebook, you should understand:
        1. How to import phenotypic data from a Terra data table to a notebook compute environment
        2. Exploring and processing these data to understand their underlying structure
        3. Defining an outcome and a set of covariates to use when modeling genotype-phenotype associations
        4. Importing, exploring, and performing quality control on genotype data
        5. Understanding population structure within the 1000 Genomes sample
        6. How to prepare a full set of input parameters and data for a genomewide association analysis pipeline
        7. How to configure the Terra data model to easily run the association pipeline

    ## Data disclaimer

    All data in this notebook (and this workspace) are publicly available thanks to the effort of many dedicated individuals:
    * Genotype and some phenotypic data were produced by the [1000 Genomes Project (phase 3)](https://www.internationalgenome.org/)
    * Individual phenotypes were modeling using the [GCTA software](cnsgenomics.com/software/gcta) and variant-level summary statistics from [MAGIC](https://www.magicinvestigators.org/), the [GIANT Consortium](https://portals.broadinstitute.org/collaboration/giant/index.php/Main_Page), the [UK Biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/), and the [MVP](https://www.research.va.gov/mvp/)

    Phenotypes were modeled to reflect the actual genetic architecture of these complex traits as closely as possible. Most single variant association results should correspond well to published GWAS, but others may not. **Results produced from these data should not be taken as representing real, replicable genetic associations. These data are provided for demonstration and training purposes only.**

    Click the "Replace" button when you are done, and Terra will begin to create a new runtime with your settings. When it is finished, it will pop up asking you to apply the new settings.

    ### A note on runtime settings
    We're catering this VM to a relatively small dataset. When using your own data, you need to consider the file size of your VCFs, which will affect not just disk size but also memory. Additionally, more workers will help the analysis go quicker.

    ## Check kernel type
    A kernel is a _computational engine_ that executes the code in the notebook. You can think of it as defining the programming language. For this notebook, we'll use a `Python 3` kernel. In the upper right corner of the notebook, just under the Notebook Runtime, it should say `Python 3`. If it doesn't, you can switch it by navigating to the Kernel menu and selecting `Change kernel`.

    # Examine phenotype data
    ----

    Now let's take a look at the phenotype distributions. In a GWAS - and statistical genetics more generally - we should always be on the lookout for correlations within our dataset. Correlations between phenotypic values can confound our analysis, leading to results that may not represent true genetic associations with our traits. Exploring these relationships may help in choosing a reasonable set of covariates to model.

    When generating plots, try to think about what we would expect a trait distribution to look like. Should it be uniform? skewed? normal? What about the distribution of two traits? What would this look like if the traits are correlated? uncorrelated? What axes of variation might confound a clear conclusion about a trait?

    We've included a number of plotting functions below to make this as easy as possible. Feel free to modify - or write your own functions - as you explore the data.
    ## Goals of this section

    1. Visualize the distribution of phenotype values
            - Within each continuous trait
                - using the kdplot function
            - Within each continuous trait, organized by dichotomous data
                - ex: the distribution of BMI in each ancestry group
                - using the boxPlot function
            - Between two continuous traits
                - with the bivariateDistributionPlot function
    2. Determine whether trait distributions follow patterns we might expect
    3. Choose an outcome and covariates to model in the second part of this workshop
    ## Code for plotting functions

    The next code block defines the plotting functions. Because running the plotting functions doesn't require understanding the syntax of the code, we have collapsed this block. Feel free to uncollapse (click the purple arrow at the right) if you're interested in all the details!

    ## Generating distribution plots

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tmajaria/ashg_2019_workshop/master/ldl_kdplot.png" align="left" width="20%">

    ***Univariate distributions*** are easily visualized in histograms or density plots. We provide a function (<font color='red'>kdplot</font>) that will generate both types of plots, overlayed in a single figure. A continuously-valued variable corresponding to a column in the phenotype dataframe should be used as input, *ldl* in this example. The function is called with the following syntax:

    ```python
    kdPlot(samples, var="ldl")
    ```

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tmajaria/ashg_2019_workshop/master/whr_hdl_bivariateDistributionPlot.png" align="left" width="20%">

    ***Bivariate distributions*** can be visualized using a scatterplot. Use the function <font color='red'>bivariateDistributionPlot</font> to visualize two continuously values variables. The *type* argument determines the type of plot generated and can be one of: "scatter", "reg", "resid", "kde", and "hex".

    ```python
    bivariateDistributionPlot(samples, var1="hdl", var2="whr", kind="scatter")
    ```

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tmajaria/ashg_2019_workshop/master/height_ancestry_boxPlot.png" align="left" width="20%">

    ***Boxplots*** can be used to further interogate relationships between continuous and categorical variables, using the <font color='red'>boxPlot</font> function. Distributions can be further subset by sex (by setting *color_by*="sex").

    ```python
    boxPlot(samples, catagorical_var="ancestry", continuous_var="height", color_by="sex")
    ```
