    # Workflow Cost Estimator
    This notebook demonstrates cost estimation for finished or in-progress workflows.

    This is an experimental feature:
      - Cost estimates may not be accurate.
      - CPUs, Memory, and runtime is pulled from Terra's Firecloud API
        [monitorSubmission](https://api.firecloud.org/#/Submissions/monitorSubmission) endpoint. This information is
        available for 42 days after workflow completion.
      - GCP Instance type is assumed custom configurations of eith N1 or N2 instance type.
